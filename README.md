- The developed app is an inventory tracking system that enables its users to manage all available items in a warehouse or other establishments that require tracking their inventory. It provides a login screen for existing users as well as signup options for new users. There are multiple tables within the app’s database to store users’ and items’ data. This app utilizes the SQLite database to provide all the necessary warehouse operations such as add, read, update, and delete functions (The database CRUD operations). The user can also enable the SMS notification to receive low inventory alerts from the system.
