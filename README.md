1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The developed app is an inventory tracking system that enables its users to manage all available items in a warehouse or other establishments that require tracking their inventory. It provides a login screen for existing users as well as signup options for new users. There are multiple tables within the app’s database to store users’ and items’ data. This app utilizes the SQLite database to provide all the necessary warehouse operations such as add, read, update, and delete functions (The database CRUD operations). The user can also enable the SMS notification to receive low inventory alerts from the system.
2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- The necessary screens and features of the app can be categorized into two distinct categories. The first category is for user authentication or creation. And the second category is for inventory management and operation. Since the main emphasis is on increasing user productivity, this app provides an organized and streamlined user interface design that efficiently enables users to take advantage of all the functionalities to perform their tasks. The app’s intuitive user interface design is simple yet functional and enables users with different levels of technical knowledge to utilize it without any difficulties.
3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
